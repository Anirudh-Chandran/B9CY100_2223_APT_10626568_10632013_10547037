####AVA ORG is a Hospital - Vendor medical device management portal, where the Vendor is a medical device manufacturer who publishes their respective products on the portal. Hospital representatives register themselves, browse published medical device products, and can contact vendors for buying the product. Also, they can add their requests for any unpublished/ unavailable medical devices. Vendors can explore these hospital requests and can connect with them for the production of specified devices. Hospitals will have to take into consideration the time required for the vendor to deliver the product. This project acts as a proof of concept.
