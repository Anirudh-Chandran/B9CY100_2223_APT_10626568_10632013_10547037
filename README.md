## Business Case:
#### AVA is a Product website from which hospital administrations can simply search, and buy medical equipment needed for their hospital. HTML and CSS has been used for designing the front-end for the website. Python is working as middleware and acting as a bridge connecting . MySQL is implemented as a backend database. ddleware and acting as a bridge connecting . MySQL is implemented as a backend database. The website being simple to use provides a lot of functionality where a vendor or a hospital staff will create their respective accounts. The home page displays a navigation bar which is helpful for quick access to the main components of the website. Navigation shortcuts to Products page, On Demand Request, and Login/ Register are mentioned.
The Products page contains a list of products which the hospital staff can browse and order when required. Clicking on the product, we are redirected to a detailed description of the product. The description includes things like the name of the product, the size, phone number and email address of the vendor who sells it.To order the product, the user will have to just click on order and a new order will be placed by the user. As hospital users will be able to login and order equipment from the portal, payment mode has not been implemented since hospitals directly pay the vendor on delivery or at the end of the month.

<Add More Info> #### On-demand request is added when the hospital has specific requirements about a product which is not available on the website ### Add details of on demand request page
